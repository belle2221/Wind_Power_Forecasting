# Wind Power Forecasting

## Introduction

Wind power forecasting is the process of predicting the amount of electricity that will be generated by wind turbines in a given time period. Accurate forecasting is crucial for integrating wind energy into the electricity grid and making informed decisions about supply and demand. This project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle, containing weather, turbine, and rotor features recorded at 10-minute intervals from January 2018 to March 2020. We aim to predict wind power generated by wind turbines using machine learning and deep learning models, including RandomForest, SARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet for anomaly detection.

## Research Insights

- (Guo et al., 2010) proposed a hybrid model for long-term wind speed forecasting, combining the first definite season index method, ARMA, GARCH models, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- (Zhang, 2003) introduced a hybrid approach that combines ARIMA and ANN models for linear and nonlinear modeling, improving forecasting accuracy.

Our project's objective is to understand various time-series forecasting methods, compare predictive accuracy, and enhance wind power forecasting.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is a time series wind turbine power dataset from Kaggle. It covers the period from December 31, 2017, to March 30, 2020, with data recorded at 10-minute intervals. The dataset comprises 22 columns, with ActivePower being the target variable.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (Before Data Pre-processing)

- The dataset contains 118,224 rows before pre-processing.
- ActivePower represents the total output power generated by the wind turbine.
- Statistical summary of ActivePower: Average = 619.11, Std Dev = 611.28, Min = -38.52, Max = 1778.03.
- The dataset exhibits seasonal patterns, with peaks occurring around July to August.

## Modeling and Anomaly Detection

### Prophet Model

- We use the Prophet model for predicting time series data patterns and trends.
- Changepoint_range parameter is set to 0.95 to adjust the history in which the trend can change.
- We predict the entire dataset to identify patterns and trends without splitting training and testing data.
- Visualizations and pattern comparisons confirm the dataset's seasonality.

### Anomaly Detection

- We calculate errors and uncertainties based on the predicted values.
- Anomalies are identified when the absolute error exceeds 1.5 times the uncertainty.
- Model evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Performance Metrics

- MAE: 335.65
- MSE: 183,829,865
- RMSE: 428.75

### LSTM Model

To predict ActivePower using the LSTM model:
1. Data is reshaped into the format `[samples, timesteps, features]`.
2. A Sequential model is used with two LSTM layers, each followed by a Dropout layer (0.2) and a Batch Normalization layer.
3. The output layer is fully connected with the number of days to forecast (30).
4. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer (learning rate: 0.0001) and mean squared error loss function.
5. EarlyStopping monitors validation loss during training, and training stops when no improvement is observed.
6. The model is trained for 200 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a validation split of 0.2.

The training stopped at epoch 84 due to no further improvement in validation loss.

The actual and predicted ActivePower values for 30 days (from 2020-03-01 to 2020-03-30) are compared and visualized.

### Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics used for the LSTM model:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 171.59
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 199.79

With these scores, it can be concluded that the LSTM model's performance is not satisfactory.

## Conclusion

This project explores the use of various time-series forecasting models for wind power prediction. While each model shows limitations in predictive performance, they demonstrate the potential for identifying anomalies in wind power generation data. Further research and model refinement may improve forecasting accuracy.

## Future Enhancements

Future work may focus on optimizing the predictive models, exploring new forecasting techniques, and addressing the limitations in forecasting accuracy.
